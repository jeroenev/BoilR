//! Keeps a Steam shortcut "running" for as long as its game runs.
//!
//! Steam counts a non-Steam shortcut as running while the program it started, or any program
//! that one starts, is alive. Some launchers start their games themselves: the EA app's
//! `EALauncher.exe` hands the game's link to the EA app and exits within seconds, so Steam
//! shows the game as stopped while it runs. Play then starts it a second time, and the
//! controller's Home button finds no game to return to. A shortcut can instead run BoilR in
//! this mode: BoilR starts the launcher with the game's link, as its own child so Steam keeps
//! tracking it, and stays alive while any program from the game's folder runs.
//!
//! Steam's overlay (and Big Picture's Resume) only reaches a game that Steam's own process
//! tree started. When the launcher is closed, BoilR's launch starts it inside that tree, so
//! the game gets the overlay; Steam then counts the game as running until the launcher
//! closes. So BoilR closes a launcher it started, once the game has closed and the launcher
//! has had time for cloud saves ([`LaunchAndWait::cloud_sync`]). A launcher that was already
//! open is left alone: it takes the link over, outside Steam's tree, without the overlay.
//! With [`LaunchAndWait::restart_launcher`] BoilR also closes an open launcher before the
//! game, so the overlay always reaches it.
//!
//! A shortcut can also start the game's own program instead of a launcher (no link). Steam
//! then starts the game itself; [`LaunchAndWait::open_first`] opens the launcher beforehand,
//! outside Steam's tree, for games that need it running.
//!
//! What happens is written to `launch-and-wait.log` in BoilR's config folder.
